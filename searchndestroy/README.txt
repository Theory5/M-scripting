USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR STUPIDITY. THIS IS NOT IDIOTPROOF IN THE LEAST.

Needed:

rkill (from bleeping computer)
adaware command line (either x32 or x64)

This program is for adware removal and general housekeeping for malware removal.

The program will remove all files in the %temp% folder (without asking!!!!).

Then it will run rkill which will kill any known malicious process or services.

Then it will update the application & definitions for Adaware.
