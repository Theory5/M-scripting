USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR STUPIDITY. THIS IS NOT IDIOTPROOF IN THE LEAST.

Needed:

rkill (from bleeping computer)
adaware command line (either x32 or x64)

Notes:

The script will expect two directories. /adaware/ and /adaware/out/ 

The script is only for targeting most adware and some malware (as per adaware's site). Don't be upset if it doesn't get your specific peice of malware.

Do not deviate from the folder structure. All logs will be deposited in /out/

This program is for adware removal and general housekeeping for malware removal.

The program will remove all files in the %temp% folder (without asking!!!!).

Then it will run rkill which will kill any known malicious process or services.

Then it will update the application & definitions for Adaware.
